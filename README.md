🌼 Iris Flower Classification Project
Ever wanted to teach a computer how to tell one flower from another? In this project, we help the computer become a flower expert!
🌸🌼🌺

✨ What does this project do?
This project creates a smart computer friend that studies real flower measurements and learns to recognize which kind of iris flower it sees:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

🚦 How does it work?
We give the computer lots of flower measurements (numbers about petals & sepals).

The computer learns the differences between the flower types.

When shown a new flower’s measurements, it tries its best to guess what type it is.

🚀 How do I run it?
Install Python (if not already installed).

Download this project and put all files in one folder.

Open a terminal in that folder.

Install needed libraries (just copy and paste):

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the code:

bash
python iris_classifier.py
Enjoy!

Watch the pretty graphs and see your computer's flower-smarts!

💡 What can I learn?
How to use computers to recognize patterns.

How we “teach” computers (machine learning!).

How to make and understand colorful graphs with real data.

📦 Requirements
See requirements.txt for all libraries.

Made with 💐 and Python by a friendly intern.
